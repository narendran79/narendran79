# 🚀 Narendran's DevOps Playground

> *"Infrastructure as code, but make it fun!"*

## 👋 Hey there, I'm Narendran!

DevOps enthusiast turning coffee into infrastructure and automation. Currently crafting cloud solutions and making servers do my bidding.

## 🔧 Tech Toolbox

```yaml
infrastructure:
  cloud: [AWS, Azure]
  containers: [Docker, Kubernetes]
  iac: [Terraform, CloudFormation]
  ci_cd: [Jenkins, GitHub Actions]
  monitoring: [Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch]
  
languages:
  - Python
  - Bash
  - YAML (it counts, right?)
  
learning_queue:
  - AWS CDK
  - Serverless Architecture
  - Advanced Kubernetes Patterns
```

## 🏗️ Featured Projects

### 🔍 Log Monitoring System
A serverless solution that scans logs for errors and sends alerts. Because sleep is overrated when your servers are having issues!

```
Logs → S3 → SQS → Lambda → SNS → Your Inbox → Panic Mode
```

### 🚢 Container Deployment Pipeline
Automated CI/CD pipeline for containerized applications. From commit to production in minutes, not days!

### 🛡️ Security Automation Tools
Scripts and tools to automate security checks and compliance. Because security should be baked in, not bolted on.

## 📊 GitHub Stats

## 🌱 Currently Growing

- Expanding my Kubernetes expertise
- Building more serverless applications
- Automating everything I can get my hands on
- Finding the perfect coffee-to-code ratio

## 💡 DevOps Philosophy

> "Automate until you can go on vacation without your phone."

I believe in:
- Infrastructure as Code (because clicking is so 2010)
- Fail fast, learn faster
- Monitoring everything that moves (and some things that don't)
- Documentation that actually helps

## 🎮 When Not Coding

- 🏃‍♂️ Running (away from production issues)
- 📚 Reading tech blogs and books
- 🎸 Playing guitar
- 🌮 Finding the best local food spots

### 🔥 Random DevOps Joke

Why do programmers prefer dark mode?

Because light attracts bugs!
